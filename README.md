Hello, 

I am Fabrice Ndie and I have been working as an English and Spanish to French translator 
for over ten years. I mainly translate IT documents for American companies. For example, 
I recently translated training videos for Skillsoft, a leading online training platform. 
Those videos were aimed at IT professionals trying to learn the Agile, Scrum and Kanban 
principles of efficient software development.

Besides that, I spend a lot of time working on tech projects as a hobby. I started with 
an Arduino Board, that I dissected in order to see how it works, from the moment the 
averdude program sends data to the microcontroller to when the bootloader receives the
data and saves it into memory.

After that, I decided to build a calculator on a breadboard. After watching a few Youtube 
videos and purchasing components on Ebay, I was able to build an 8 bits calculator that
adds, subtracts, divides and multiplies.

But the project which gave me a holistic understanding of programming, from how compilers 
translate source codes to instructions to how those instructions are executed by the 
processor, is the JPEG decoder and encoder that I wrote in C++. Indeed, I first had to 
reverse engineer the JPEG library, which I did with Hopper Disassembler, in order to 
understand how it works.

After that, I went through countless hours of testing and debugging to create a functional
algorithm. I am still perfecting the final version of the program, but a working copy 
is available here on Github. 

Regards,
Fabrice Ndie
